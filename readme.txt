create a VM (ansible engine machine) to manage the openstack host (ansible client machine)
configure /etc/hosts with openstack as alias for the openstack host machine and give it the IP address (include ping test later on the script ans.sh)
configure the cloud-admin user with "openstack" as password
configure the openstack host to allow ssh public key authentication or create a stack user for more scope for the management machine to manage the openstack cloud.
create a VM to host OpenStack
install openssh-server on the openstack host
edit /etc/ssh/ssh_config for PasswordAuthentication yes
collect the user of the VM and it's creadentials to use on ansible host machine for ssh connection
use ssh_config playbook to configure a passwordless connection for further playbooks and security (public test key ssh)

# Purpose|
#--------+-----------------------------------------------------
# This script will create a VM with the following attributes;
# Virtual Machine Name = ScriptedVM
# Location of Virtual Machine = /VMFS/volumes/storage1/ScriptedVM
# Virtual Machine Type = "Microsoft Windows 2003 Standard"
# Virtual Machine Memory Allocation = 256 meg

#Custom Variable Section for Modification|
#----------------------------------------+---------------------
#NVM is name of virtual machine(NVM). No Spaces allowed in name
#NVMDIR is the directory which holds all the VM files
#NVMOS specifies VM Operating System
#NVMSIZE is the size of the virtual disk to be created

/////
The script in Code Listing 4.6 will create a virtual machine that has the
following characteristics:



 


  
A VM called ScriptedVM in a directory named ScriptedVM on
storage1

  
 A VM that will be assigned 256MB of memory

  
 A VM that will have a 4GB SCSI hard drive (lsilogic controller)

  
 A VM configured for a Windows 2003 standard operating system

  
A floppy drive assigned, not connected at startup

  
 A CD-ROM attached to the ESX server's CD-ROM drive, not connected
at startup

  
An Ethernet adapter connected to the VM Network, enabled at startup

 

The exec commands in the script are system-level commands in Linux to
set up the writing to, and saving of, the script file. It redirects the console
screen's output to the script file.The use of the echo commands in the script
sends the commands to the screen which are redirected to the file for
writing.The file is then closed and the virtual configuration file,VMX, is
saved.The permissions are changed on the configuration file so any user on
ESX can access the virtual machine.Then the script creates the virtual disk
and registers the VM with the ESX server.


Use the following process to set up your script on the ESX server:



 


  
 Log in locally or connect to your ESX server remotely.

  
 Log in with an ID that has root privileges (see Figure 4.9).
